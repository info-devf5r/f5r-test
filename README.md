Hello, this is a mini project made by Dipesh Ranjan.
To start the application, navigate to the directory on the terminal and use command "node index.js" it should return "Server running on port 3000". 

NOTE - To run the application you need to have node.js installed in your laptop/pc. Other than that if you are still recieving some sort of error. Remove the "node_modules" folder and reinstall the dependencies(check package.json file) in the terminal using npm install "package name" command. 

With these you will be able to smoothly access the chat application. Open any browser and type "localhost:3000". To check the application you can open in a different browser and interact as two different individuals.
